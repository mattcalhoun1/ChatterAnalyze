This is the ChatterBox Mesh Graph Visualization app.

An example graph is also included to give you an idea of what you can see.

At the time this graph was generated (from a device in my basement), I have 2 good
"base" deployments, "base.2" and "south". I also have a device "school" which doesn't
have a great antenna, but happens to be in a central location.

As I would expect, looking at the graph, those 3 have several green connections with
one another and various other devices. This means they have been discovered as 
sort of "hubs" and will be used for most traffic, if meshing is involved. If one of them
became powered off or went missing, it's connections show up as yellow and eventually go
missing completely from the graph, and it would cease to be a hub device. If was powered back
up, it would quickly regain its status as a "hub" just by the normal ping and mesh traffic.

You can plug into the USB micro port of any ChatterBox (assuming it has mesh graph logging turned on)
and get a visualization of what that ChatterBox's view of the mesh graph is. This can be useful for
seeing how well the graph data is propagating, looking for good/bad connections, and things like that.

If a device has gone missing or been powered off for some time, it should eventually disappear from the graph.

The direction arrows indicate which way the connection goes (it's usually both ways, but not necessarily).

Green : Very strong/consistent connection
Blue : Pretty good connection
Yellow : Connected, but inconsistently

requires:
python 3

pip packages:
  pyserial
  numpy
  matplotlib
  pyqt6
  networkx

On Linux (for me), the ChatterBox shows up on port: /dev/ttyACM0, /dev/ttyACM1, /dev/ttyUSB0, or /dev/ttyUSB1
On Mac, the ChatterBox typically shows up on a port like: /dev/cu.usbmodem14101

to run, connect a ChatterBox via USB and run:
python mesh_graph_app.py

If you know which USB port the ChatterBox is on, you can identify it like:
python mesh_graph_app.py -p /dev/ttyACM0

If you don't specify, the app will cycle through various ports looking until it finds (if it does).

If you'd rather see indirect connections of the mesh graph, rather than direct, choose:
python mesh_graph_app.py -d

To exclude certain devices from the visualization, create a text file with the names of devices (one per line), use:
python mesh_graph_app.py -e /home/matt/my_exclusions.text
